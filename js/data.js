    "commentary": "This is one of my favorite martial arts movies, even in the realm of Van Damme flicks. It's a little less campy but still quite ridiculous. Think of The Quest as a mix of Mortal Kombat with classic Van Damme action. And yes, there are splits.",

Forced to compete, Christopher faces the ultimate test of manhood where one wrong move could cost him not only the competition but his life.

    "commentary": "Robot Jox is a classic mecha romp from 1989. I have watched it many, many times and it is always a mix of awesome and cheese. Don’t expect great acting, but do expect memorable stop-motion mecha fights.",

    "backText": [
      "Directed by Stuart Gordon (RE-Animator), ROBOTJOX reveals a world where nations settle their territorial disputes by a single combat match between two giant machines.

Refusing to face Alexander in a rematch, Achilles is replaced by Athena (Anne-Marie Johnson, TV’s Melrose Place), a genetically engineered combat fighter. So When the GenJox is nearly killed and the game is forfeited, Achilles avenges their honor by challenging Alexander to a winner-take-all death match, in this heavy-metal, sci-fi adventure.",

    "commentary": "This is a movie I used to rent with a fury, never realizing how esoteric it was. I never actually owned a copy until a couple years ago when I started looking for it again. This German DVD is the only DVD I could find, but thankfully it has an English audio track. Its super cheesy and super nostalgic. Should be a really fun watch.",

    "commentary": "The best way I can describe this movie is \"a Christian musical action-drama\". It is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and trust me, I have watched a lot of bad movies. Its bound to make us suffer together, but that is kind of the point of the movie night.",
