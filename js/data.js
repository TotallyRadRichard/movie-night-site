    "commentary": "The best way I can describe this movie is \"a Christian musical action-drama\". It is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and trust me, I have watched a lot of bad movies. Its bound to make us suffer together, but that is kind of the point of the movie night.",

    "backText": [
      "When the evil General Fear brings a new level of bad to NME's operations, Commander Kellie and the Superkids are in for the fight of their lives. Armed with deception as his weapon, the General unveils The SWORD!",
      "But will his most subtle deception destroy the only organization powerful enough to stop him?",
      "Watch Commander Kellie, Paul, Missy, Rapper, Valerie and Alex as they seek to prove that God's Word is more powerful than any SWORD—and any deception—the enemy could ever create!",
      "Powerful, Word-packed songs, nonstop action and the uncompromised Word of God explode on the screen. A riveting adventure for the whole family with messages of salvation, love and the supreme power of the truth!"
