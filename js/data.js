    "commentary": "This is a movie I used to rent with a fury, never realizing how esoteric it was. I never actually owned a copy until a couple years ago when I started looking for it again. This German DVD is the only DVD I could find, but thankfully it has an English audio track. Its super cheesy and super nostalgic. Should be a really fun watch.",

    "commentary": "The best way I can describe this movie is \"a Christian musical action-drama\". It is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and trust me, I have watched a lot of bad movies. Its bound to make us suffer together, but that is kind of the point of the movie night.",
